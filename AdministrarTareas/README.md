# Task Manager

This project is a simple task management web application that allows users to manage their tasks using localStorage. The application includes features for fetching tasks, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as completed.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the task management web page, including a form for adding tasks and a list to display tasks.
- **css/styles.css**: The stylesheet that defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the task management interface.
- **js/app.js**: The JavaScript file that manages tasks. It sets up event listeners and functions for task management but does not yet implement data collection.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

3. **Open the project in your code editor**.

4. **Install the Live Server extension** in your code editor if you haven't already.
